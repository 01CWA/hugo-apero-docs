Lots of ways!

# Meet blogdown

--

An R package...

--

that lets you create websites in RStudio...

--

and use R Markdown...plots, tables, outputs!

???

So what is blogdown?

It is an R package... can I get a show of hands for everyone here who uses R? OK keep them up...

That lets you create websites in RStudio...can I get all of you R users to keep your hand up if you use RStudio, so lower your hand if you don't use RStudio

Perfect, thanks! So this is one of the first perks of blogdown, which is that you can build a website in the RStudio IDE using tools you are familiar with, and you won't need very much else to start.

# Why R Markdown?

class: center, middle

# Why R Markdown?

--

Develop your code and ideas in reproducible documents

--

Knit plots, tables, and results together with narrative text

--

Create analyses ready to be shared

--

Plus: Use RStudio IDE

--

Use the tools you already use (or should be using- `r emo::ji("wink")`) for your work

# Who is Hugo?

??? 

The package helps you to use a static site generator named Hugo. If you didn't understand much of the last sentence I said, that is OK! The main thing you'll want to know is that Hugo gives you over 100 themes to choose from, so you can create a custom-looking website, in the same way that Wordpress offers website themes.

One difference here is that you own your content, and the entire pipeline for creating it, from start to finish, which I think is a huge benefit to users. You control what, you control when, you control how.
